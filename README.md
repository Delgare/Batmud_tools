# Batmud_tools

This repo consists of tools for the game batmud. The tools will be added as the need for them arises. 

I have written the path_reverse function in python, but I will have to learn the scripting language batclient uses to be able to incorporate the tools into the game client.

Purpose for these tools is to learn coding and familiarize myself in software developement and managing data. Also, to help the gameplay obviously!
